{% include gallery id="about"%}

I graduated from West Virginia University (WVU) with a degree in Computer Engineering, a minor in Computer Science, and a minor in Economics. While at WVU, I focused my time on the University Rover Challenge (URC) Team and on robotics research projects. 

For three years, I led software development and robot autonomy on the [WVU URC Team](/projects/urc). In this role, I led the development of resilient autonomy systems that were instrumental to the team's multiple top placements in the international competition. 

My time spent on research focused on two projects: [Loopy](/projects/loopy/) and [Retailbot](/projects/retailbot/). While working on Loopy, I co-authored an IROS 2023 conference paper on swarm robotics and robotic morphogenesis. While working on Retailbot, I integrated an indoor mapping and autonomy stack as part of the NSF-funded project.
