{% include gallery id="about"%}

I recently graduated from West Virginia University (WVU) with a degree in Computer Engineering, a minor in Computer Science, and a minor in Economics. During my time at WVU, I served as the Programming and Algorithms Team Lead for the [University Rover Challenge Team](/projects/urc) where I led software development and robot autonomy efforts for three consecutive years. In this role, I developed resilient robot autonomy systems, and contributed to multiple top placements in international, collegiate-level robotics competitions. 

My robotics experience also includes IROS publication of [swarm robotics research](/projects/loopy/), and [integrating a mapping and autonomy system](/projects/retailbot/) on an indoor ground-based robot as part of an NSF-funded research project.
